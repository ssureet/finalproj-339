		<p>I am a professional photographer with over 5 years of experience. 
			I focus on fashion-based portrait photography, but have experience
			in event and editorial photography, as well.</p>

		<p>
			I have worked in several environments from studio settings to outdoor shoots
			to street style shooots. I have shot photos for news journals, engagements,
			graduations, seniot photos, and brand photos, as well. </p>
			
		<p>My work has been published several times for my political photo journalism 
			and editorial work. I previously worked as the lead photographer for a clothing brand,
			and am currently a photo editor for <a href = "https://sheimagazine.com/"> SHEI Magazine</a>
			, the only fashion, culture, and arts student organization recognized by the University 
			of Michigan.
